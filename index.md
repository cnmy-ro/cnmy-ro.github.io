Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate at the Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden) working on accelerating MR imaging. I like spending my free time building interesting artifacts (code, artwork, blog), reading, and cycling.

This website (currently WIP) serves as a centralized hub showcasing my work and contributions, both professional and personal.
