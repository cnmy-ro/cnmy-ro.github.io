Welcome to my website.

I am a PhD candidate at the Leiden University Medical Center (the Netherlands) developing computational methods for accelerating MR imaging. I like spending my free time building interesting artifacts (electronics, code, artwork, etc.), reading, and cycling.

This website serves as a compendium of my work and contributions, both professional and personal.
