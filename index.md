Welcome to my website.

I am a PhD candidate at the Leiden University Medical Center (Netherlands) working on accelerating MR imaging and more broadly interested in imaging systems, representation learning, and deep generative learning. I like spending my free time building interesting artifacts (electronics, code, artwork, etc.), reading, and cycling.

This website serves as a compendium of my work and contributions, both professional and personal.
