# Personal Website
 
Based on the Jekyll theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).



--------------
## Development
To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test the theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/test/`. This starts a Jekyll server using content in the `test/` directory. As modifications are made to the theme and test site, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
