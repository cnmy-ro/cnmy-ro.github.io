I have a background in electronics engineering and artificial intelligence, with a focus on signal and image processing, computer vision, and deep learning. In general, I have always been interested in imaging systems and intelligent vision algorithms. More recently, this interest of mine was drawn towards deep learning methods applied to medical image analysis, synthesis, and reconstruction problems.
