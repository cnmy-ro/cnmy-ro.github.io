Apart from my work, I like spending time tinkering with software and electronic hardware, writing code, and building useful applications. Up until now I have mostly worked solo on my personal projects, but I have recently grown more interested in team-based open source software (OSS) development. I look foward to contributing more to OSS projects in future, especially those in my domains of expertise.

On this page, you can find a list of both my personal OSS projects as well those which I have contributed to. Click on them to visit their GitHub repositories.
