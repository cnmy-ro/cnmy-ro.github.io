Following is a selection of my research code and personal OSS projects (ranging from machine learning to computational art and philosophy). Visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/cnmy-ro/) for a more complete list.


## Research Code

- **PnP-CoSMo**: Iterative algorithm for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction based on content/style modeling. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cnmy-ro/pnp-cosmo)

- **LL-MR**: Low-level utilility library for computational MRI. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cnmy-ro/llmr)

- **MRF-Sim**: Python library for MR fingerprinting. Implements sequence description, EPG simulation, and dictionary matching. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cnmy-ro/mrfsim)

- **ROCI**: Repository of computational imaging algorithms. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cnmy-ro/roci)

- **Ganslate**: Simple and extensible GAN image-to-image translation framework. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/ganslate-team/ganslate)



## Personal Projects

- **Nabla**: Automatic differentiation engine (a.k.a. "autograd") wrapper over NumPy. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cnmy-ro/nabla)

- **Psybernetic Art**: Open-source computational art. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cnmy-ro/psybernetic-art)

- **Ethica**: Computational exploration of the [*Ethics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza%27s_Ethics) of Benedict de Spinoza. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cnmy-ro/ethica)

- **StyleGAN**: Simplified re-implementation of StyleGAN [(Karras et al. CVPR 2019)](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Karras_A_Style-Based_Generator_Architecture_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper.html) in PyTorch. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cnmy-ro/stylegan)
