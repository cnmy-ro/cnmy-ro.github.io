I have a background in electronics engineering and artificial intelligence, with a professional interest in signal processing, generative modeling, representation learning, and imaging systems. More recently, this interest was drawn towards problems in medical image analysis, synthesis, and reconstruction.

Following is a short overview of my publications. For a more complete account, visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aNaTofQAAAAJ&hl=en) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinmay_rao).
