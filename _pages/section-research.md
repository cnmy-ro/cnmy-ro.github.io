I have a background in electronics engineering and artificial intelligence, with a professional interest in signal processing, imaging systems, computer vision, and deep learning. More recently, this interest was drawn towards problems of medical image analysis, synthesis, and reconstruction.

Here you'll find an overview of (a selection of) my projects and publications. For a more complete list, visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aNaTofQAAAAJ&hl=en) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinmay_rao) profiles.
