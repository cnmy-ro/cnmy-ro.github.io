Welcome to my website!

I am a 24 year-old Indian man currently living in the Netherlands. By profession, I am a full time PhD candidate at the Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum (LUMC, Leiden) working towards accelerating MR image formation using modern deep learning methods. In my free time, I mostly enjoy working on interesting technical projects, reading, and communicating my ideas via sketching, painting, and writing.

I created this website to serve as a centralized personal platform where I can showcase all of my work and contributions, both professional and personal. Feel free to reach out to me via email or any of my social media handles, all of which are listed on the sidebar.

Note: This website is a work in progress
